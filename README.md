## Deployment
Deployed to [dubbha-remix-jokes.fly.dev](https://dubbha-remix-jokes.fly.dev/). Depending on the security configuration of your local machine the Deployment part of the tutorial might not go exactly as described, e.g. due to the `api.machines.dev` host access being blocked by `Infoblox BloxOne`, as in my case. I was able use the nice [Fly's Web CLI](https://fly.io/terminal) instead to deploy from github directly. If you've tried deploying locally and failed, first rollback all the local leftovers, or just don't push them to the repo.
